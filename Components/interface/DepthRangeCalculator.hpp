/// depth values. It writes the results to a buffer with the following layout:
///
///     struct DepthRange
///     {
///         float SceneNearZ;
///         float SceneFarZ;
///         float SceneNearDepth;
///         float SceneFarDepth;
///     };
///
/// * `SceneNearZ` is always less than `SceneFarZ`.
/// * `SceneNearDepth` is the depth value corresponding to `SceneNearZ`.
/// * `SceneFarDepth` is the depth value corresponding to `SceneFarZ`.
/// * Note that if reverse depth is used, `SceneNearDepth` will be greater than `SceneFarDepth`.
///
/// \remarks `SceneNearZ` and `SceneFarZ` must be positive values.
